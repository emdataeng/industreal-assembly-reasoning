## Scenario Summary

| Scenario | Status | Message | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement support | PASS | 57 requirements inspected; 0 inconsistent requirement-support records. | `requirement_support_results.csv` |
| Hard incompatibility | PASS | 2 incompatibility constraints inspected; 0 were not rejected with trace evidence. | `incompatibility_results.csv` |
| Rejected-step isolation | PASS | 6 rejected steps inspected; 0 rejected-step isolation violations. | `rejected_step_isolation_results.csv` |
| Removal invalidation | PASS | 10 removal effects inspected; 0 invalidation inconsistencies. | `removal_invalidation_results.csv` |
| Reduced confidence | PASS | accepted step became uncertain after confidence reduction | `reduced_confidence_results.csv` |

## Requirement Support Summary

- Requirements inspected: 57
- Supported: 27
- Missing: 30

## Incompatibility Summary

- Incompatibility cases inspected: 2
- Rejected due to incompatibility: 2

## Rejected-Step Isolation Summary

- Rejected steps inspected: 6
- Isolation violations: 0

## Removal Invalidation Summary

- Removal effects inspected: 10
- Invalidation failures: 0

## Reduced-Confidence Perturbation Summary

- Perturbed rows: 1
- Result statuses: {'PASS': 1}

## Warnings, Failures, And Skipped Checks

- None.

## Thesis Interpretation

The generated evidence is suitable for filling Table \ref{tab:evaluation-validation-response}: it separates baseline Layer 4 behavior from the controlled reduced-confidence perturbation and records the exact CSV/JSON evidence for each scenario.

Status totals: PASS=5, FAIL=0, WARNING=0, SKIPPED=0.
